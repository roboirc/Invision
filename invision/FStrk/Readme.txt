This is File Server Tracker Addon for Invision Version 1.0a      March 18, 2001

This will track and keep records on File Servers in the channel(s) you specify.

This was originally wrote on request from BsNightmare but I figured others might have use for it as well.

It has been tested to track both Invision and Polaris File servers. 

If you didn't get this from the invision site (http://invision.lebyte.com) or me personally I can't vouch for its functionality nor the fact that it could have been changed to perform malicious acts. 

This 'should' work with polaris as well since I wrote it to be as independant as possible though I make no guarantee. Further more it 'should' work just about any other script but will not appear near as nice as it will with invision.

If you haven't checked out Invision yet please get it try.
